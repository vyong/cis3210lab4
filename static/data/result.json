            "lead_paragraph": "The Marquesa de Varela is at home -- for a change -- in London. A trompe l'oeil peacock on the wall regards the woman in sweatpants with red hair and a not insignificant chest as she nervously paces this rather ordinary town house overgrown with gilded throne chairs and embassy-foyer trimmings. Though she lives in the upper registers of less-fashionable Fulham, the marquesa has Prince Ernst of Hanover as a neighbor -- and doesn't hesitate to say so. She knows things like that, the marquesa. She has to in her line of work: the snaring of celebrities and royals for the pages of Hello! magazine, pornography for a certain caste that wishes it could reliably pronounce the word ''Gstaad.'' The marquesa is what is known in the trade as a celebrity wrangler. At least one of this species is on staff at every major magazine obliged to enter the matrix of celebrity journalism. A wrangler generally answers to ''West Coast bureau chief,'' ''special projects director'' or ''entertainment editor,'' but everywhere the job is the same: to corral these preening unicorns by any means possible. Years before InStyle and Us magazine came along, Hello! was locking up cover-worthy faces and exclusive exclamation-point interviews. (The difference, of course, was that the marquesa often presented a check for the privilege.) The weekly raised a bubbly toast to Lladr\u00f3-level schmaltz and Ruritanian excess in flashy scrapbook spreads with happy-pill headlines. Between ''The Wedding,'' ''The Baby,'' ''The Heartbreak'' and, inevitably, ''The Divorce'' -- the points of Hello!'s compass -- there was always an opulent new residence to behold, a flurry of designer clothes blowing around every hard-won featurette stamped with the quirky signature, ''Co-ordination: Marquesa de Varela Int. Ltd.''",
